## üì¶ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quangdat2511/smart-motion-system.git

### 2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA

### 3. Set the Java language level

  - Set **Project SDK** to: `corretto-1.8 Amazon Corretto 1.8.0_452`

> This ensures the project uses Java 8, which is compatible with the source code and prevents issues such as missing `javax.xml.bind` classes found in later Java versions.
