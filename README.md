**Course:** Physics for Information Technology
**Instructors:** Mr. Cao Xuan Nam, Mr. Dang Hoai Thuong
**University:** University of Science, VNU-HCM
**Semester:** 2024-2025, Semester 3
Smart Motion System is an IoT-based security solution that detects motion, 
captures images, and sends real-time alerts. It supports remote alarm control,
human detection, and web-based monitoring with cloud storage.

- JPA / Hibernate, Spring Data JPA
- RESTful API
- MQTT protocol for real-time communication

### 💻 Frontend

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- JSP, jQuery, AJAX

### 🗄 Database

- MySQL (for user accounts data)
- Firebase Realtime Database (motion sensor data)

### 🔧 Architecture

- 3-layer architecture (Controller - Service - Repository)
- Clear separation of concerns for scalability and maintainability

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quangdat2511/smart-motion-system.git
```

### 2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA

### 3. Set the Java language level

- Go to `File > Project Structure` (or press `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S`)
- Under the **Project** tab:
    - Set **Language level** to: `8 - Lambdas, type annotations, etc.`
    - Set **Project SDK** to: `corretto-1.8 Amazon Corretto 1.8.0_452`

> This ensures the project uses Java 8, which is compatible with the source code and prevents issues such as missing `javax.xml.bind` classes found in later Java versions.

### 4. Configure the MySQL database

- Open the file `database/insert_database.sql`, copy its contents, and run it in your MySQL DBMS.
- Update the `application.properties` file with your own MySQL credentials:
  ```properties
  spring.datasource.username=your_username
  spring.datasource.password=your_password
  ```

### 5. Import and Build the Project

#### a. Reload Maven Projects

1. Open the Maven tool window in IntelliJ (**View > Tool Windows > Maven**).
2. Click the **Reload All Maven Projects** button to sync dependencies from `pom.xml`.

#### b. Build the Project

Open the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

> This will download all dependencies, compile the code, run tests, and package the application.

### 6. Set up Tomcat 8.5.34 deployment in IntelliJ IDEA

1. Go to **Run > Edit Configurations...**
2. Click the `+` icon → select **Tomcat Server > Local**
3. In the **Server** tab, click **Configure...** and set the path to your local **Tomcat 8.5.34** installation.
4. In the **VM options:** field, paste:
   ```
   -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8
   ```
5. Switch to the **Deployment** tab.
6. Click the `+` button → choose `spring-boot:war exploded` (recommended).
7. Click on **Application context** and leave it empty.
8. Configure the HTTP port:
    - By default, the HTTP port is set to **8080**.
    - If port 8080 is already in use, you can change it to another port (e.g., 8081) by modifying the **HTTP port** field.
9. Click **OK** to save the configuration.

> If you don't have Tomcat installed, download version 8.5.34 from:  
> [https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.34/bin/](https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.34/bin/)

### 7. Run the Project

- Click the green **Run** button next to your Tomcat configuration in IntelliJ.

### 8. Access the Application

Open your browser and go to:

```http
http://localhost:8080
```

> If you configured a different port in the Tomcat settings (e.g., 8081), replace `8080` with your custom port:
>
> ```http
> http://localhost:8081
> ```

This will load the main page of the application.

## 8. Default Accounts

The system comes with a few pre-configured user accounts for testing purposes:

| Username   | Role     | Password |
| ---------- |----------| -------- |
| nguyenvana | MANAGER  | 123456   |
| nguyenvanb | OPERATOR | 123456   |
| nguyenvanc | OPERATOR | 123456   |
| nguyenvand | OPERATOR | 123456   |

> ⚠️ **Note:** These accounts are for demonstration and testing only. Do not use them in a production environment.

## 9. How to Log In

1. Open your browser and visit: [http://localhost:8080/login](http://localhost:8080/login)
2. Enter one of the default usernames and the password `123456`.
3. After logging in:
   - MANAGER: Full access
   - OPERATOR: No access to account management
