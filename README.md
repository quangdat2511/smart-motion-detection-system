  - Set **Language level** to: `8 - Lambdas, type annotations, etc.`
  - Set **Project SDK** to: `corretto-1.8 Amazon Corretto 1.8.0_452`

> This ensures the project uses Java 8, which is compatible with the source code and prevents issues such as missing `javax.xml.bind` classes found in later Java versions.
